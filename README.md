# README - How to run the code

Please run this notebook in Google Colab

There are two main components in this notebook:

PyTorch-free implementation (Building from scratch)
PyTorch implementation
The first one is the assignment 1 code for COMP5329, and the second one is only for comparasion prupose. This instruction is for the first implementation only.

Run section 1-Libraries & Util, 2-Data Preprocessing and 3-Multilayer Perceptron Model sequencially, since they are only the defination of the functions and classes used in the notebook.
Run section 4-Training and Evaluation. 4.1 is the data preparation for the rest of the code, which should not be modified. 4.2 and 4.3 are the defination of functions for training and evaluating respectively, which will be used in the follwing parts. 4.4 is the main training and evaluating for different methods and techiques used in deep neural networks and please run them sequencially. Each subsection (4.4.x) is able to run separately. Please re-run 4.5 if you want to play around with the TensorBoard dashboard since the UI is not saved when saving this notebook.
